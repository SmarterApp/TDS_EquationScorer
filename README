The AIR Equation Scoring Engine is a Python application for evaulating
answers to tests in mathematics. The answers are submitted in MathML,
and are evaluated by comparing to a MathML rubric, using the Sympy
symbolic mathematics package.

The AIR Equation Scoring Engine consists of two assemblies. The main engine
has a Python API. It depends only on Sympy. This is located in the package
"airscore"

The second assembly provides a RESTful web interface to the main engine. This
assembly depends on Django and the Django REST framework, in addition to the
dependencies for the main assembly. 

DEPENDENCIES
============
The AIR Equation Scoring Engine was developed on Python 2.7.5.

All of the required libraries can be installed from PyPi using
"pip install <package-name>"

Sympy: http://sympy.org/en/index.html
Django: https://www.djangoproject.com/
Django REST framework: http://django-rest-framework.org/

INSTALLATION
============
After downloading the project, add the directory "lib" to your Python path, or
else copy or symlink the contents of "lib" into a directory that is on your
Python path.

If you are using the REST interface, you must also add the directory
"eqscorer_rest" to your Python path, or else copy or symlink the contents of
"eqscorer_rest" into a directory that is on your Python path.

NOTES FOR ECLIPSE USERS
=======================
The project directory may be opened as a PyDev-Django project in eclipse. However
Eclipse makes default assumptions about the location of the settings module that
are wrong for this project. Eclipse users should open the project properties
window and select the "PyDev - Django" page. On this page, set the value for
"Django settings module" to "eqscorer_rest.settings"

If you do not perform this step, you will receive errors when attempting to run
the test server via "Run As -> PyDev: Django"
